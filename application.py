Demo Flask application to test the operation of Flask with socket.io

Aim is to create a webpage that is constantly updated with random numbers from a background python process.

===================

Updated 13th April 2018

+ Upgraded code to Python 3
+ Used Python3 SocketIO implementation
+ Updated CDN Javascript and CSS sources
